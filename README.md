# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch TheOdinProject
I just finished up a really cool project I wanted to tell you about. I built a browser version of something like a mix between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It was quite the challenge, but also super rewarding!

I had to do a lot of searching online to figure out the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use. But you know what? That's what made it so fun and educational. I got to apply what I already knew and learn new things along the way.

If you're interested, I can walk you through the basic steps, but I think you'd really enjoy tackling it yourself too. Let me know if you want to give it a shot!

Steps: 

Instead of manually adding each div in the HTML, I used JavaScript to generate them dynamically. It was a bit tricky at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty smooth sailing.

To organize the grid, I put all the divs inside a container div and used Flexbox to make them appear in a grid layout. Flexbox was a bit challenging, but I wanted to stick to what I've learned so far before diving into CSS Grid

One of the fun parts was adding a hover effect so that the grid squares change color when you mouse over them. It really brings the sketchpad to life!

And get this, I even added a button that pops up a prompt asking how many squares per side you want in the grid. So you can customize it to your liking!

Oh, and for some extra credit, I experimented with transforming the behavior of the squares. I made them randomize their color with each interaction and introduced a progressive darkening effect. It was a bit challenging, but totally worth it.

Once I was done, I pushed the project to GitHub to keep track of my progress and share it with others.

Overall, it was a super fun project and a great way to practice my DOM manipulation skills.
